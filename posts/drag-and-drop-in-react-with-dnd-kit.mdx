Drag-and-drop UI interactions are very common on the web. It allows users to interact with the applications we create in an intuitive and natural way. Building such interfaces in an accessible and performant way has always been challenging. In this post, we are going to attempt overcome this challenge with the power of DnD Kit, a modular library for building drag & drop interfaces in React.

## Core Concepts

In most drag-and-drop interactions, there are usually two kinds of components involved:

- **Draggable components** which are elements on a page that we can pick up, drag and drop in specified areas; and
- **Droppable components**, which are elements that act as the _'specified areas'_ that draggable elements can be dropped over.

You can see these components in action by playing around in the demo below:

<DraggableAndDroppable />

### Draggable Components

DndKit provides us with a React hook called `useDraggable`. This hook can transform any HTML element into a draggable source that can be dragged and dropped over droppable Components.

To break down how this hook works, let's think of the steps that we may need to take to make an HTML element draggable:
